# Code Review 

1. Alan, the code is clear to understand, the flow makes it easy to read. 
2. Code Logic is also easy to understand, tested and code can be reusable.Also, I like the fact that 
you have a dataset included for testing the package. 
# Classes
 you made the classes as requested  by the assignment. 

#suggestion
 I would probably summarize the docstring and the PEP 8 only issue was some lines were too long

#Score 
Score: 2,
