# What I like
1.The code is clean and easy to read
2.you added a dataset for easy use of pretty_null

#Constructive criticism
I don't have much to say...
Me being picky,  for your add_time function,
i'd go ahead make it where you can check if it's
in date_time format and if not then it'll convert it
and do the rest.
